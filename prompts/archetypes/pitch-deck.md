# Pitch Deck Archetype

## What This Is
A startup pitch deck presentation - the kind shown to investors to raise funding. Professional, compelling, and data-driven.

## Structure (10-12 slides)

1. **Title Slide** - Company name, tagline, presenter name
2. **Problem** - What pain point are you solving?
3. **Solution** - How do you solve it?
4. **Market Size** - TAM/SAM/SOM or market opportunity
5. **Product** - Screenshots, features, demo highlights
6. **Traction** - Key metrics, growth charts, milestones
7. **Business Model** - How you make money
8. **Competition** - Market landscape, your differentiation
9. **Team** - Key team members and their backgrounds
10. **Financials** - Revenue, projections, key metrics
11. **Ask** - How much you're raising and what it's for
12. **Contact** - How to reach you

## Visual Style

## Color Palette

Use a professional palette:
- Primary: Deep blue or sophisticated color
- Accent: One bright accent for highlights

- Charts: 2-3 coordinated colors

## Typography

## Technical Implementation

Use reveal.js-compatible structure:
```html
<div class="reveal">
  <div class="slides">
    <section>Slide 1</section>
    <section>Slide 2</section>
  </div>
</div>
```

Include basic reveal.js functionality inline for navigation.
